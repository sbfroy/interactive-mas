## 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

## 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Review lessons at session start

## 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Run the code, check the output, demonstrate correctness
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

## 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Minimal code impact.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary.

## Project-Specific Notes

- All state models use **Pydantic v2 BaseModel** — not TypedDict, not raw dicts
- Agent prompts are **.md template files** in `src/prompts/`, loaded via `prompt_loader.py`
- LLM JSON responses are parsed through the **json_sanitizer** pipeline (try parse → extract → repair → fallback)
- Every LLM call is logged via **interaction_logger** to `logs/`
- Agents are **async functions**, not classes
- The Memory agent returns **structured JSON** matching `MemoryUpdate` Pydantic schema
- Test each agent in isolation before wiring into the graph
