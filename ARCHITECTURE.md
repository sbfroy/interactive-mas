# Architecture

## Design Philosophy

The system tells an interactive story as a stream of short (~5s) video clips chained together via image-to-video (i2v), layered with live voice-over commentary on top. The user types natural-language guidance between clips; the story keeps flowing whether or not the user speaks.

A single well-briefed LLM can in principle do every job this system does. The hypothesis we are testing is that **a single LLM does not hold up over long horizons** — context balloons, facts drift, setups get dropped. Splitting the work across specialized agents with clear responsibilities and explicit communication should produce more coherent long-horizon storytelling at a tolerable latency cost.

The roster is **four agents**, each owning exactly one job, with no overlap.

- **Tolkien** — the beat writer. Decides what happens in the next ~5s (prose narration, mechanical action, outcome) and keeps the narrative direction current.
- **Spielberg** — the shot composer. Translates Tolkien's beat into a concrete image-to-video prompt: camera, composition, motion, on-screen elements, continuity from the previous clip's last frame.
- **Attenborough** — the voice-over commentator. Reads Tolkien's beat and Spielberg's shot and writes the spoken line that plays over the clip. Always emits text; optionally fires ElevenLabs TTS when audio is enabled.
- **Spock** — the memory and context curator. After each turn, updates the structured world state and the rolling narrative memory. Before the next turn, hands Tolkien a filtered context brief — only what he needs to know right now, including the currently-relevant characters and locations.

All four agents emit **structured output** via Pydantic schemas. The `json_sanitizer` pipeline repairs malformed JSON from the local model before parsing.

## One-Turn-Delayed Feedback Loop

Spock's updates from turn N are available to Tolkien at turn N+1. Tolkien does not see his own turn's state update within the same turn — he sees it on the next one. If Tolkien references something slightly wrong this turn, it gets corrected on the next. Over ~5s clips, this is imperceptible.

This is a load-bearing design choice. It means:

- Agents never wait on each other mid-turn — the pipeline has a simple forward shape.
- Tolkien never sees his own state update in the same turn that produced it, which prevents self-reinforcing drift.
- The cost of a one-turn-late correction is negligible at ~5s cadence.

Every `.md` prompt template and every agent spec in this document assumes this loop. It is the single most important implicit contract between agents.

## Pipeline Buffer (Delay-as-Feature)

When video generation is live, the MAS runs **ahead of the viewer** by roughly 6 clips (~30s). At boot, the pipeline pre-generates ~30s of video (and its matching commentary audio, if enabled) before playback starts. After that, every user command is queued and lands on the next *unrendered* clip, not the currently-playing one.

This is not a technical wart — it is narrative smoothing:

- User says "jump in the pool" → the MAS does not hard-cut. Tolkien has 1–2 turns to ease into it (character walks toward pool, pauses at the edge, then jumps).
- The story keeps flowing during silence. The user is not prompted; they *optionally* steer.
- Abrupt tonal or logical shifts get absorbed across several clips instead of snapping.

Architectural consequences:

1. **Story must keep moving when the user is silent.** The MAS does not block on user input. If the next clip is due and the user has said nothing, Tolkien advances on the current `short_term_narrative`.
2. **User input enters a queue.** It is applied to the next unrendered clip at the time Tolkien composes that clip's beat. Earlier queued clips play out unmodified.
3. **Two clocks.** The MAS's internal clock (one turn = one clip in the build queue) and the viewer's subjective clock (~6 clips behind). The one-turn-delayed feedback loop refers to the internal clock.

For the benchmark we **bypass the buffer** and run synchronously turn-by-turn, logging prompts and Attenborough's commentary text only — no actual clips or audio are generated. The buffer is a runtime concern, not an evaluation concern.

## Story Blueprint

The story world is defined once in `story.json` — a blueprint that establishes everything the agents need before the first turn. All fields are static and read-only during a run.

```python
class Location(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str

class Character(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str

class Story(BaseModel):
    title: str
    synopsis: str
    visual_style: str
    tone_guidelines: str                  # voice/register anchor for Attenborough's commentary
    locations: list[Location]
    characters: list[Character]           # includes protagonist as the first entry
    world_constraints: list[str]
    narrative_premise: str
    long_term_narrative: str              # single direction
    short_term_narrative: str             # single direction, seeded from blueprint

    @classmethod
    def from_json(cls, path: Path) -> "Story":
        return cls(**json.loads(path.read_text()))
```

Each field has a primary audience:

| Field | Who reads it |
|---|---|
| `title`, `synopsis` | All agents (context framing) |
| `visual_style` | Spielberg |
| `tone_guidelines` | Attenborough |
| `locations` | Spielberg (full); Spock (full, for use in `context_brief`) |
| `characters` | Spielberg (full); Spock (full, for use in `context_brief`); Tolkien (protagonist entry only — always visible) |
| `world_constraints` | Tolkien (upfront self-check instruction) |
| `narrative_premise` | Tolkien, solo baseline |
| `long_term_narrative` | Tolkien (read + rarely updates) |
| `short_term_narrative` | Tolkien (read + updates every turn) |

We keep **exactly one** `long_term_narrative` and **exactly one** `short_term_narrative`. Experience from a prior project (Comic Chaos) showed that plural directions cluster and dilute focus. A single short-term direction is easily reshaped by the user's next command; a single long-term direction is sticky and only changes when the story fundamentally pivots.

`tone_guidelines` is Attenborough's exclusive anchor — it shapes his voice, cadence, and register (dry, earnest, deadpan, nature-documentary, etc.) without needing a re-brief every turn. Spielberg and Tolkien stay unaware of it; their tonal signals come from `visual_style` and `narrative_premise` respectively. Coordination between Spielberg and Attenborough happens implicitly through `Beat.narration` — both agents read the same prose source, so the visual and the voice land together without the agents talking to each other.

## Scenario

The scenario is separate from the story. It is a bare JSON list of user command strings — no schema, no Pydantic model.

```json
["Wake up.", "Look around my quarters.", "..."]
```

Loaded directly in the runner:

```python
turns = json.loads(Path("test_scenario.json").read_text())
for turn_number, user_input in enumerate(turns, start=1):
    ...
```

The single benchmark scenario is 100 turns that test inventory persistence, character tracking, world rule consistency, location continuity, and long-horizon coherence — all woven into one continuous playthrough.

## State (Pydantic Models)

State is lean. Most of it is prose that agents read as context. Structured portions are kept small and mergeable.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Beat(BaseModel):
    """Tolkien's structured output per turn."""
    narration: str                           # 2–4 sentence prose paragraph telling what happens in this ~5s

    """Attenborough's structured output per turn."""
    voiceover: str                           # spoken text — ~1–3 short sentences, paced for ~5s of audio
    tone_note: str                           # one-line self-note on the chosen register (dry, hushed, etc.)

    """Spock's structured state update, merged into StoryState.world_state."""
    characters: dict[str, dict] = Field(default_factory=dict)  # partial updates
    protagonist_location: str = ""                             # empty = unchanged
    inventory: list[str] | None = None                         # None = unchanged; list = replace
    notes: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)             # freeform notable state

class MemoryUpdate(BaseModel):
    """Spock's structured output per turn."""
    world_state_delta: WorldStateDelta
    narrative_memory: str                    # rolling compressed prose, updated every turn
    context_brief: str                       # filtered context for Tolkien's next turn (incl. relevant chars/locs)

class HistoryEntry(BaseModel):
    turn: int

    # History
    history: list[HistoryEntry] = Field(default_factory=list)

    # Meta
    config_name: str = ""

    # Blueprint — set once at initialization
    title: str = ""
    synopsis: str = ""
    visual_style: str = ""

    narrative_premise: str = ""

    def get_recent_history(self, count: int = 5) -> list[HistoryEntry]:
        return self.history[-count:]

    @classmethod
    def initialize(cls, story: Story, config_name: str) -> "StoryState":
        return cls(
            title=story.title,
            synopsis=story.synopsis,
            visual_style=story.visual_style,
            tone_guidelines=story.tone_guidelines,
            locations=list(story.locations),
            characters=list(story.characters),
            world_constraints=list(story.world_constraints),
            narrative_premise=story.narrative_premise,
            long_term_narrative=story.long_term_narrative,
            short_term_narrative=story.short_term_narrative,
            config_name=config_name,
        )
```

`narrative_memory` grows every turn, but the growth is smart: Spock compresses older content into higher-level strokes while recent events stay detailed. The prompt explicitly instructs rolling compression. There is no hard token cap — the prompt carries a soft target (`narrative_memory_target_tokens` from config) that Spock is told to drift toward, not enforce.

`world_state` accumulates by merging `WorldStateDelta`s. Fields left blank in a delta mean "unchanged." `inventory` is `None` for unchanged, a concrete list for replacement (simpler than computing add/remove sets inside the model).

## Agents

Each agent is an async function:

```python
async def agent_name(state: StoryState, llm: LLMBackend, config: Config, logger: InteractionLogger) -> dict
```

Returns a partial state dict that the graph merges.

### Tolkien — Narrator

The creative core. Writes the beat for this turn and keeps the narrative direction current.

**Receives (via prompt):**
- `narrative_premise`, `world_constraints`
- `long_term_narrative`, `short_term_narrative`
- The protagonist entry from `characters[0]` (name + description) — always visible, since he writes about this character every turn
- Spock's `context_brief` (filtered slice — any OTHER currently-relevant characters and locations with names + one-line summaries, current location, inventory highlights, recent commitments)
- `user_input` (possibly empty if the user is silent)

**Writes:** `current_beat` (`Beat`) carrying `narration` (2–4 sentence prose paragraph — the richest downstream source), `action` (mechanical events for Spielberg), `outcome` (state-delta hint for Spock), and the updated `short_term_narrative`. Occasionally updates `long_term_narrative`.

**Does NOT receive:** `visual_style`, `tone_guidelines`, full non-protagonist character or location descriptions, raw `world_state`. These are other agents' domains.

Tolkien's prompt includes an explicit self-check: respect `world_constraints`, do not contradict `context_brief`. There is no reactive consistency gate — prevention is cheaper than cure, and Spock's one-turn-delayed corrections keep drift bounded.

On silent turns (empty `user_input`), Tolkien advances on `short_term_narrative` without stalling. Silence is normal.

**Turn 1 bootstrap.** At turn 1 there is no prior Spock output, so `context_brief` is empty. Tolkien opens the story himself using the blueprint material he already has (premise, constraints, narrative directions, protagonist entry, user_input). This is deliberate: Tolkien is the creative lead and is in control of how the story starts.

### Spielberg — Shot Composer

The visual director. Turns Tolkien's beat into a concrete image-to-video prompt.

**Receives (via prompt):**
- `visual_style` (the permanent visual anchor)
- Full `locations` and `characters` from the blueprint
- `current_beat` (Tolkien's just-written output — especially the prose `narration`)
- The previous clip's `end_frame_description` (for continuity)
- Current `protagonist_location` (from `world_state`; defaults to `locations[0].name` when unset)

**Writes:** `current_shot` (`Shot`) with the i2v prompt, camera, composition, motion, on-screen roster, continuity note, and end-frame description.

Spielberg always re-anchors on the locked visual descriptors from the blueprint every turn. The character looks the way the blueprint says; the setting is described as the blueprint specifies. This is how visual consistency survives across 100 chained clips — not via a separate continuity agent, but via Spielberg's discipline of re-reading the source of truth every turn.

How props enter, scenes transition, and characters arrive is left to Spielberg's judgment, guided by `visual_style` and `narrative_premise`. A studio-white-void story calls for one set of entrance conventions; a gritty cyberpunk story calls for another. Spielberg is the director — he figures it out from the blueprint. The architecture does not hardcode entrance patterns.

### Attenborough — Voice-Over Commentator

The narrator-in-the-mix. Writes the spoken line that plays over the clip — in whatever register `tone_guidelines` asks for.

**Receives (via prompt):**
- `tone_guidelines` (the voice anchor)
- `current_beat` (especially the prose `narration`)
- `current_shot` (camera + motion + end-frame, so the commentary lands on visible action)
- Recent `HistoryEntry.commentary` from the last ~5 turns (so he doesn't repeat himself and his rhythm carries over)

**Writes:** `current_commentary` (`Commentary`) with a short spoken line (~1–3 sentences, paced for ~5s of audio) and a one-line `tone_note` recording the chosen register.

Coordination with Spielberg happens implicitly: both read the same `Beat.narration`. The visual and the voice land together because they come from the same prose source.

**Audio side effect.** After Attenborough produces text, the runtime optionally sends `voiceover` to ElevenLabs TTS when `audio_enabled: true`. When `audio_enabled: false` (the default, and always true in benchmark mode), the text is logged and nothing else happens. This mirrors the video toggle — the agent's structured output is the benchmark-relevant artifact; audio and video generation are runtime niceties. TTS failures are caught and logged — they never break the turn.

### Spock — Memory and Context Curator

Memory is Spock's whole identity. Two output shapes (structured state + prose memory + a filtered brief), one cognitive act: *know what's true, surface what's relevant*.

**Receives (via prompt):**
- `current_beat`, `current_shot`, `current_commentary` (this turn's outputs)
- Current `world_state` (accumulated dict)
- Current `narrative_memory` (rolling prose)
- Full blueprint `locations` and `characters` (so Spock can pull relevant names + one-line summaries into `context_brief` on demand)
- Recent history (last ~5 entries)

**Writes:** `MemoryUpdate` containing:
1. `world_state_delta` — structured merge applied to `world_state`. Partial updates only; unmentioned fields preserved.
2. `narrative_memory` — full replacement of the rolling prose memory. Spock is instructed to compress older events into high-level strokes while keeping recent events detailed. Drifts toward `narrative_memory_target_tokens` from config (soft target, not a hard cap).
3. `context_brief` — a filtered prose brief for Tolkien's next turn. Deliberately lean. Pulls from `world_state`, `narrative_memory`, and the blueprint's character/location entries to surface only what Tolkien needs: which OTHER characters are currently in scene (names + one-line summaries), where he is (location name + one-line summary), what's in his hands, what direction the story is heading, and any recent commitments that should influence the next beat.

The `context_brief` is the load-bearing mechanism for long-horizon coherence. A monolithic LLM at turn 80 has all context in one wall of tokens; solo degrades as that wall grows. Spock's brief grows only with current story complexity, not with run length — one-line summaries of currently-active props and characters, not the entire cast.

## Turn Execution Order

Per turn, in order:

1. **Read user input** (may be empty).
2. **Tolkien** reads `context_brief` (from last turn's Spock), `short_term_narrative`, `long_term_narrative`, protagonist entry, and user input. Writes `current_beat` + updated narrative direction.
3. **Spielberg** reads `current_beat`, `visual_style`, full blueprint `locations` + `characters`, previous `end_frame_description`. Writes `current_shot`.
4. **(Optional)** the i2v model renders a clip from `current_shot.i2v_prompt` + the previous clip's last frame. Skipped in benchmark mode and when `video_enabled: false`.
5. **Attenborough** reads `tone_guidelines`, `current_beat`, `current_shot`, recent commentary history. Writes `current_commentary`.
6. **(Optional)** ElevenLabs TTS renders `current_commentary.voiceover`. Skipped in benchmark mode and when `audio_enabled: false`.
7. **Spock** reads `current_beat`, `current_shot`, `current_commentary`, current `world_state`, current `narrative_memory`, full blueprint chars/locs, recent history. Writes `world_state_delta`, new `narrative_memory`, new `context_brief`.
8. **Commit** the history entry (`turn`, `user_input`, `beat`, `shot`, `commentary`).

The context Spock writes in step 7 is the context Tolkien reads in step 2 of the *next* turn. That delay is the one-turn-delayed feedback loop.

## Graph Topology

### Solo (`solo_graph.py`)

One LLM handles everything. It receives the **entire blueprint** — including full `locations` and `characters`, `visual_style`, `tone_guidelines`, premise, constraints, both narrative directions — and emits a single structured response containing `Beat`, `Shot`, `Commentary`, and `MemoryUpdate` in one call. The question solo answers is "can a well-briefed single LLM match a decomposed pipeline?", not "can an unbriefed LLM?".

```
User Input → Solo (single structured response: Beat + Shot + Commentary + MemoryUpdate) → Output
```

Solo does the same work as the MAS — just without the split. Both configurations produce all four shapes every turn.

### MAS (`mas_graph.py`)

Four specialized agents.

```
User Input
    → Tolkien       (beat: narration + action + outcome + short/long-term direction)
    → Spielberg     (shot / i2v prompt)
    → Attenborough  (voice-over commentary)
    → Spock         (world_state, narrative_memory, context_brief)
    → Output
```

Strictly sequential. Spielberg depends on Tolkien's beat; Attenborough depends on both; Spock depends on all three. There is no retry loop — Tolkien respects rules upfront, Spock catches drift on the next turn.

## Prompt Templates

Agent prompts live as `.md` files in `src/prompts/`, loaded at runtime via a simple template loader:

```python
# src/util/prompt_loader.py
from functools import lru_cache
from pathlib import Path

@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def _read_file(filepath: str) -> str:
    return Path(filepath).read_text(encoding="utf-8").strip()

def load_prompt(filepath: Path, **kwargs) -> str:
    content = _read_file(str(filepath))
    return content.format(**kwargs) if kwargs else content
```

Each agent has a `system.md` and `user.md`. Variables are substituted at call time. Agents only see the blueprint fields relevant to their job.

Each prompt ends with a schema block that describes the structured output the agent must produce. The schema block lists fields, types, and purpose in plain text — not a raw JSON schema dump.

## JSON Sanitizer

Local models (Gemma 4) will occasionally produce malformed JSON. The `json_sanitizer.py` module provides repair functions shared by all four agents and solo.

Reference implementation is in `reference/json_sanitizer.py`. Study it and adapt — keep only what this project needs.

Parse strategy for structured responses:

1. Try direct `json.loads()`.
2. If that fails, try `extract_json()` (pulls JSON out of surrounding text).
3. If that fails, try `repair_json()` (fixes common malformations).
4. If all fail, log the failure and skip the update for this turn.

Skipped updates mean the state stays unchanged for that turn. This is safer than partial application.

## Interaction Logger

Every LLM call is logged to `logs/` as structured JSON. Each session gets its own log file. This is the primary output for benchmark evaluation — logs are reviewed post-hoc by a human or an LLM, not scored by an automated pipeline.

Reference implementation is in `reference/interaction_logger.py`. Study and adapt.

A logged interaction captures everything needed to reconstruct a run:

```json
{
  "session_id": "20260418_143022",
  "config": "mas",
  "scenario": "test_scenario",
  "story": "Lego Man in the White Void",
  "interactions": [
    {
      "agent": "tolkien",
      "turn": 5,
      "timestamp": "2026-04-18T14:30:45",
      "model": "google/gemma-4-31b-it",
      "parameters": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1024},
      "prompt": {"system": "...", "user": "..."},
      "response": {"raw": "...", "parsed": {"narration": "...", "action": "...", "outcome": "...", "short_term_narrative": "..."}},
      "token_usage": {"prompt": 2100, "completion": 450},
      "latency_ms": 1230
    }
  ]
}
```

## LLM Backend

Both Gemma 4 and OpenAI GPT-4o are called through the same interface via OpenAI-compatible APIs:

```python
class LLMBackend(ABC):
    async def generate(self, messages: list[dict], temperature: float = 0.7, max_tokens: int = 1024) -> tuple[str, dict]:
        """Returns (response_text, token_usage)."""
```

- **Gemma 4 31B** — local vLLM on `localhost:8000`, OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **GPT-4o** — OpenAI API, `OPENAI_API_KEY` from env.

## Context Management

Agents are stateless between calls. Context is reconstructed each turn as prose.

- **Tolkien** — receives premise + constraints + long/short narrative + protagonist entry + Spock's filtered `context_brief` + `user_input`. On turn 1 the `context_brief` is empty; Tolkien opens from the blueprint alone.
- **Spielberg** — receives `visual_style` + full blueprint locations/characters + Tolkien's beat (including `narration`) + previous `end_frame_description` + current location.
- **Attenborough** — receives `tone_guidelines` + `current_beat` (especially `narration`) + `current_shot` + recent commentary history.
- **Spock** — receives beat + shot + commentary + current `world_state` + current `narrative_memory` + full blueprint chars/locs + recent history.
- **Solo** — receives the full blueprint (including `tone_guidelines`) + full rolling state + recent history + user input in one call, and emits `Beat + Shot + Commentary + MemoryUpdate` as a single structured response.

Both solo and MAS contexts grow as the run progresses — there is no hard token cap on either side. The MAS grows **slower and smarter**: Spock's `context_brief` and `narrative_memory` compress older material into higher-level strokes while keeping recent events detailed, so what Tolkien and Attenborough see each turn stays lean and focused on what matters now. Solo accumulates linearly — every character, location, rule, and full rolling state payload lands in its prompt every turn, and the prompt grows monotonically with history. That delta is the central bet of the architecture.

## Configuration

Configs are YAML files loaded into Pydantic models:

```yaml
name: "mas"
description: "Tolkien → Spielberg → Attenborough → Spock"
graph: "mas_graph"
llm_backend: "gemma"
model: "google/gemma-4-31b-it"
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens_per_agent: 1024
context_window_history: 5
narrative_memory_target_tokens: 800
video_enabled: false
video_buffer_clips: 6
audio_enabled: false
elevenlabs_voice_id: ""          # required when audio_enabled: true
```

`video_enabled: false` and `audio_enabled: false` are the defaults for benchmark runs. When `audio_enabled: true`, Attenborough's `voiceover` is sent to ElevenLabs and audio files are written to `logs/audio/`; when `false`, the text is still produced, still logged, and simply not spoken — keeping benchmarks cheap and reproducible.
