## Project Context

You are building **ClankerStudios** — a multi-agent system (MAS) for interactive storytelling, built with LangGraph. The story plays as a flowing sequence of ~5-second video clips chained via image-to-video (i2v), layered with live voice-over commentary, with the user optionally steering the story between clips through natural-language commands.

This is an academic project for IKT469 (Deep Neural Networks) at the University of Agder. It has two purposes:

1. A working interactive storytelling system with a terminal UI.
2. A benchmark comparing a single well-briefed LLM against a 4-agent MAS, evaluated post-hoc from session logs.

## Read These First

Before writing any code, read ALL of these:

- `CLAUDE.md` — your working instructions
- `README.md` — overview and structure
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — design philosophy, agent specs, state schema, turn execution order, pipeline buffer, one-turn-delayed feedback loop
- `BENCHMARK.md` — research question, experiment matrix, evaluation approach
- `story.json` — the story blueprint (synopsis, visual_style, tone_guidelines, locations, characters, rules, premise, narrative directions)
- `test_scenario.json` — the 100-turn benchmark scenario

These are the source of truth. Follow them closely.

## Reference Implementations

The `reference/` folder contains:

- `json_sanitizer.py` and `interaction_logger.py` — battle-tested utilities from a previous project. Study, keep only what this project needs, adapt to this project's models and conventions. Do not copy blindly.
- `blueprint.json` and `narratron.system.md` — prior-project blueprint and narrator prompt. Use as stylistic inspiration for the new blueprint and prompts; do not carry over panel/comic-specific structure.
- `i2v_chaining_test.ipynb`, `wan_test.ipynb`, `wan2.2_i2v_local_test.ipynb` — i2v chaining experiments. Context only; not used by the runtime code in this project.

## Key Patterns

1. **Pydantic v2 BaseModel everywhere** — state, configs, story, and all LLM response schemas are Pydantic models. Not TypedDict, not raw dicts.

2. **Prompt templates as .md files** — agent prompts live in `src/prompts/` as Markdown files with `{variable}` placeholders. Loaded at runtime via `src/util/prompt_loader.py` using `lru_cache` + `.format(**kwargs)`.

3. **All four agents emit structured output.** Tolkien emits `Beat`, Spielberg emits `Shot`, Attenborough emits `Commentary`, Spock emits `MemoryUpdate`. Solo emits all four in a single structured response. Every structured response passes through the `json_sanitizer` repair pipeline.

4. **JSON sanitizer pipeline** — local Gemma 4 will occasionally produce malformed JSON. Parse strategy: try direct parse → extract → repair → skip and log.

5. **Interaction logger** — every LLM call gets logged to `logs/` as structured JSON. Each session gets its own file. This is the primary benchmark output — evaluation happens post-hoc from these logs.

6. **Story blueprint** — the story is defined once in `story.json` with `title`, `synopsis`, `visual_style`, `tone_guidelines`, `locations[]`, `characters[]`, `world_constraints[]`, `narrative_premise`, `long_term_narrative`, and `short_term_narrative`. Each field has a primary audience (see ARCHITECTURE.md) — agents only see the subset their role needs.

7. **One-turn-delayed feedback loop** — Spock's state updates from turn N are read by Tolkien at turn N+1. Never within the same turn. This is load-bearing: it keeps the graph strictly forward and prevents self-reinforcing drift.

8. **Pipeline buffer (when video is live)** — the MAS runs ~6 clips ahead of the viewer. User input enters a queue and applies to the next unrendered clip. Story must keep flowing on silent turns. Video and audio generation are opt-out; benchmark mode bypasses the buffer and runs synchronously.

9. **Audio is opt-out.** Attenborough always runs and always produces structured `Commentary` text (logged). `audio_enabled: true` additionally pipes `Commentary.voiceover` through ElevenLabs TTS. The default is `false`.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangGraph** — graph-based multi-agent orchestration
- **Pydantic v2** — all models
- **OpenAI SDK** — HTTP client for both vLLM (Gemma 4) and OpenAI API (GPT-4o)
- **Rich** — terminal UI
- **vLLM** — serves Gemma 4 locally on `localhost:8000` (started separately by the user)
- **ElevenLabs SDK** — optional TTS for Attenborough (only invoked when `audio_enabled: true`)
- **PyYAML** — configs

## What to Build

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

**Pydantic models**:

- `src/state/story_state.py` — `StoryState` as defined in ARCHITECTURE.md, plus `HistoryEntry`. Lean, text-first. Includes blueprint fields (including `tone_guidelines`) set once at initialization.
- `src/models/story.py` — `Story`, `Location`, `Character`. Loaded from `story.json`. Includes `tone_guidelines`.
- `src/models/config.py` — `Config` loaded from YAML. Includes `audio_enabled` and `elevenlabs_voice_id` alongside the existing video fields.
- `src/models/responses.py` — `Beat`, `Shot`, `Commentary`, `WorldStateDelta`, `MemoryUpdate`. `Beat` has a prose `narration` field (2–4 sentences) plus `action`, `outcome`, and narrative directions. No dialogue field — the protagonist does not speak.

**Utility modules** (`src/util/`):

- `prompt_loader.py` — load and format .md prompt templates.
- `json_sanitizer.py` — JSON repair pipeline. Adapt from `reference/json_sanitizer.py`.
- `interaction_logger.py` — log every LLM call to `logs/`. Adapt from `reference/interaction_logger.py`.

**LLM backends** (`src/llm/`):

- `base.py` — abstract `LLMBackend` with `async generate(messages, temperature, max_tokens) -> tuple[str, dict]`. Returns `(response_text, token_usage)`.
- `gemma.py` — calls vLLM on `localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions` using the `openai` SDK with `base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1"`. Model from config.
- `openai_backend.py` — calls OpenAI API. Key from `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var.

Both backends: handle errors gracefully, return token usage, async, log via `interaction_logger`.

**TTS adapter** (`src/tts/`):

- `elevenlabs.py` — thin adapter around the ElevenLabs SDK. Called only when `audio_enabled: true`. API key from `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` env var, voice from `elevenlabs_voice_id` in config. Writes audio files to `logs/audio/`. Fails soft: if TTS errors, log and continue — the text is already captured, and TTS must never break the turn.

**Configs** (`configs/`):

- `solo.yaml` — single LLM, fully briefed.
- `mas.yaml` — four agents.

Both load into the `Config` Pydantic model.

### Phase 2: Prompts

Create all templates in `src/prompts/`. Each agent gets a `system.md` and `user.md`. The user template uses `{variable}` placeholders filled at call time.

**Critical: blueprint fields are split by audience.** See ARCHITECTURE.md for the full table. Briefly:

- **Tolkien** gets `narrative_premise`, `world_constraints`, `long_term_narrative`, `short_term_narrative`, the **protagonist entry only** (name + description from `characters[0]`), Spock's `context_brief` (which surfaces any other currently-relevant characters/locations with names + one-line summaries, plus inventory highlights and recent commitments), and `user_input`. Does NOT get `visual_style`, `tone_guidelines`, full non-protagonist character or location descriptions, or raw `world_state`.
- **Spielberg** gets `visual_style`, full `locations[]`, full `characters[]`, Tolkien's `Beat` (especially `narration`), previous clip's `end_frame_description`, current `protagonist_location` (defaults to `locations[0].name` when unset).
- **Attenborough** gets `tone_guidelines`, `current_beat` (especially `narration`), `current_shot` (camera + motion + end-frame), and recent commentary history (last ~5 entries' `Commentary.voiceover`).
- **Spock** gets `current_beat`, `current_shot`, `current_commentary`, current `world_state`, current `narrative_memory`, full blueprint `locations[]` + `characters[]` (so he can surface relevant ones in the brief), and recent history.
- **Solo** gets the entire blueprint (including `tone_guidelines`) plus the full rolling state and recent history — in one structured call that emits all four response shapes.

Prompt file list:

- `narrator.system.md` / `narrator.user.md` — Tolkien. Creative beat writing: emit a prose `narration` (2–4 sentences — this is the richest downstream source), a mechanical `action`, an `outcome`, and the updated `short_term_narrative`. Include the self-check: respect `world_constraints`, do not contradict `context_brief`. Instruct Tolkien to advance on `short_term_narrative` when `user_input` is empty, and to actively look for callback opportunities when props or bits from earlier in the run surface in the brief. On turn 1 there is no `context_brief` — Tolkien opens the story himself from the blueprint material.
- `director.system.md` / `director.user.md` — Spielberg. i2v shot composition. Instruct Spielberg to re-anchor on the locked blueprint descriptors every turn (this is how visual consistency survives long runs). Must describe continuity from the previous `end_frame_description` and produce a new `end_frame_description` for the next turn. How props enter and scenes transition is Spielberg's judgment call, guided by `visual_style` and the beat — do NOT hardcode entrance patterns (summon / walk-in / etc.) in the prompt.
- `commentator.system.md` / `commentator.user.md` — Attenborough. Writes `Commentary.voiceover` (~1–3 short sentences, paced for ~5s of audio) plus a one-line `tone_note`. Anchored on `tone_guidelines`. Must land on what's visible in `current_shot`, build off `Beat.narration`, and avoid recycling phrasings from recent commentary history.
- `spock.system.md` / `spock.user.md` — Spock. Structured `MemoryUpdate`. Emphasize: `world_state_delta` MERGES (unmentioned fields preserved). `narrative_memory` is rolling prose, compressed older / detailed recent, drifts toward `narrative_memory_target_tokens` as a soft target (not a hard cap). `context_brief` is the filtered slice for Tolkien's next turn — deliberately lean; surfaces relevant characters/locations with names + one-line summaries pulled from the blueprint, plus inventory highlights, current direction, and recent commitments.
- `single_llm.system.md` / `single_llm.user.md` — one agent produces `Beat` + `Shot` + `Commentary` + `MemoryUpdate` in a single structured response. Fully briefed with the entire blueprint including `tone_guidelines`.

Each prompt ends with a plain-text description of the structured output fields the agent must produce (not a raw JSON schema dump).

### Phase 3: Agents

Each agent is an async function:

```python
async def agent_name(state: StoryState, llm: LLMBackend, config: Config, logger: InteractionLogger) -> dict
```

Returns a partial state dict that the graph merges.

**Tolkien — Narrator** (`src/agents/narrator.py`):

- Reads from `state`: `narrative_premise`, `world_constraints`, `long_term_narrative`, `short_term_narrative`, `characters[0]` (protagonist), `context_brief`, `user_input`.
- Writes: `current_beat` (`Beat`), updates `short_term_narrative`, optionally `long_term_narrative`.
- Advances on `short_term_narrative` when `user_input` is empty — never stalls.
- Turn 1 has an empty `context_brief`; Tolkien opens from blueprint material alone.

**Spielberg — Director** (`src/agents/director.py`):

- Reads from `state`: `visual_style`, full `locations`, full `characters`, `current_beat`, previous `Shot.end_frame_description` (from `history[-1].shot` if present), `world_state.protagonist_location` (defaults to `locations[0].name` when unset).
- Writes: `current_shot` (`Shot`).
- Re-anchors on blueprint descriptors every turn for visual consistency.

**Attenborough — Commentator** (`src/agents/commentator.py`):

- Reads from `state`: `tone_guidelines`, `current_beat`, `current_shot`, recent commentary history via `get_recent_history(config.context_window_history)`.
- Writes: `current_commentary` (`Commentary`).
- If `config.audio_enabled: true`, hands the `voiceover` text to `src/tts/elevenlabs.py` and writes the resulting audio file path into the log. If TTS fails, catch and log — never let TTS failure break the turn.

**Spock — Memory and Curator** (`src/agents/spock.py`):

- Reads from `state`: `current_beat`, `current_shot`, `current_commentary`, `world_state`, `narrative_memory`, full blueprint `locations` + `characters`, recent history.
- Writes: merged `world_state`, new `narrative_memory`, new `context_brief`.
- MERGES `world_state_delta` into `world_state` — unmentioned fields preserved. `inventory` is `None` for unchanged, list for replacement.
- `context_brief` surfaces currently-relevant characters and locations with names + one-line summaries (drawn from the blueprint), plus inventory highlights, current direction, and recent commitments.

**All agents:**

- Load prompts via `prompt_loader`.
- Log every call via `interaction_logger`.
- Parse structured output via `json_sanitizer`.
- Target per-agent context budgets from ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Phase 4: Graphs

**Solo** (`src/graph/solo_graph.py`) — 1 agent, fully briefed, single structured response carrying `Beat` + `Shot` + `Commentary` + `MemoryUpdate`:

```
Input → Solo → (Beat + Shot + Commentary + MemoryUpdate merged into state) → Output
```

**MAS** (`src/graph/mas_graph.py`) — 4 agents sequential:

```
Input → Tolkien → Spielberg → Attenborough → Spock → Output
```

No retry loop. Tolkien handles rule compliance upfront; Spock catches drift on the next turn via the one-turn-delayed feedback loop.

LangGraph prefers TypedDict for state, but agents work with Pydantic internally. Bridge at the graph boundary — `state.model_dump()` to pass in, `StoryState(**state_dict)` to reconstruct — or use LangGraph's Pydantic state support if available.

### Phase 5: Terminal UI

(`src/ui/terminal.py`)

A minimal terminal view of the story as it unfolds. Each turn, print a short textual rendering of the current `Beat` (`narration` + `action` + `outcome`) and the current `Commentary.voiceover` so the user can follow along without rendering video or audio. The point is to validate the pipeline, not to be pretty.

- Rich for styling.
- Input prompt between turns — user may type a command or press Enter to let the story advance on its own.
- On startup: display `title`, `synopsis`, and protagonist info.
- Ctrl+C to quit.

### Phase 6: Benchmark Runner

(`src/eval/runner.py`)

Run the scenario through a config. For each of the 100 turns: feed the user command, run the graph synchronously (bypassing any pipeline buffer), log everything via `interaction_logger`. Save the full session log to `logs/`.

No judge, no metrics, no report generation. Just run and log. Evaluation happens afterwards.

### Phase 7: Entry Point

**`main.py`** with argparse:

- `play` — interactive (optional `--scenario` to drive from a file instead of stdin).
- `benchmark` — run the scenario against both configs, log everything.

## Guidelines

- **Pydantic everywhere** — state, config, story, responses. Not raw dicts.
- **Prompt templates as .md files** — never hardcode prompts as Python strings.
- **Blueprint fields split by audience** — follow the table in ARCHITECTURE.md. Do not hand Tolkien the full `visual_style`, `tone_guidelines`, or non-protagonist character/location descriptions.
- **All four MAS agents + solo produce structured output** — always go through the json_sanitizer pipeline.
- **One-turn-delayed feedback loop** — Tolkien reads Spock's previous turn's `context_brief`, never this turn's.
- **Story must keep flowing when the user is silent** — Tolkien advances on `short_term_narrative`.
- **Log every LLM call** — via `interaction_logger`.
- **Audio and video are opt-out side effects** — Attenborough's text is produced and logged regardless; TTS fires only when `audio_enabled: true`.
- Async everywhere, type hints everywhere.
- `logging` module, not print.
- Errors handled gracefully — a failed parse skips that turn's update rather than crashing. TTS and i2v failures never break the turn.
- Functions over classes where possible (agents are async functions).
- Follow the project structure exactly.

## What NOT to Build

- No web frontend.
- No database.
- No Docker.
- No vLLM management (user starts it separately).
- No model fine-tuning.
- No automated judge or scoring pipeline.
- No matplotlib reports.
- No live video or audio generation in the benchmark path (runtime-only, opt-out).
- No hardcoded prop-entry patterns (summon / walk-in / etc.) — Spielberg decides from the blueprint.

## Build Order

1. Pydantic models (state, config, story, responses — `Beat` with `narration`, `Shot`, `Commentary`, `MemoryUpdate`, `WorldStateDelta`). No dialogue / `Line` model — the protagonist does not speak.
2. Utility modules (`prompt_loader`, `json_sanitizer`, `interaction_logger`).
3. LLM backends.
4. Prompt templates (.md files).
5. Tolkien alone → verify with a manual single-turn test.
6. Add Spielberg → verify two-agent output.
7. Add Attenborough (text-only at first; audio toggle later) → verify three-agent output.
8. Add Spock → verify full MAS loop with Spock's `context_brief` feeding Tolkien's next turn.
9. Build the solo graph (single structured response with all four shapes).
10. Build the MAS graph.
11. ElevenLabs TTS adapter; wire behind `audio_enabled`.
12. Terminal UI.
13. Benchmark runner.
14. Main entry point.

Test each step before moving on.
