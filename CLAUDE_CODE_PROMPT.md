## Project Context

You are building **interactive-mas** — a multi-agent system (MAS) for interactive storytelling, built with LangGraph. Users type commands to steer a protagonist through a story. Agents collaborate behind the scenes to generate coherent narrative.

This is an academic project for IKT469 (Deep Neural Networks) at the University of Agder. It has two purposes:
1. A working interactive storytelling system with a terminal UI
2. A benchmark comparing different agent configurations, evaluated post-hoc from session logs

## Read These First

Before writing any code, read ALL of these:
- `CLAUDE.md` — your working instructions (plan mode, verification, task management)
- `README.md` — overview and structure
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — state schema, agent specs, graph topology, context management, prompt template pattern, JSON sanitizer, interaction logger
- `BENCHMARK.md` — experiment matrix, evaluation approach
- `story.json` — the story blueprint (setting, protagonist, rules, narrative premise)
- `test_scenario.json` — the 100-turn benchmark scenario

These are the source of truth. Follow them closely.

## Reference Implementations

The `reference/` folder contains implementations of `json_sanitizer.py` and `interaction_logger.py` from a previous project. These are battle-tested but written for a different context.

**Study them critically before using:**
- Understand the patterns and logic
- Remove anything this project doesn't need
- Adapt to this project's models and conventions
- Keep them as clean and minimal as possible
- Don't copy blindly

## Key Patterns

1. **Pydantic v2 BaseModel everywhere** — state, configs, story, scenarios, and LLM response schemas are all Pydantic models. Not TypedDict, not raw dicts.

2. **Prompt templates as .md files** — agent prompts live in `src/prompts/` as Markdown files with `{variable}` placeholders. Loaded at runtime via `src/util/prompt_loader.py` using a simple `lru_cache` + `.format(**kwargs)` pattern.

3. **JSON sanitizer pipeline** — LLMs (especially local Gemma) will produce malformed JSON. Only the Memory agent (Sheldon) needs JSON parsing. Parse strategy: try direct parse → extract → repair → skip and log.

4. **Interaction logger** — every LLM call gets logged to `logs/` as structured JSON. Each session/run gets its own file. This is the primary benchmark output — evaluation happens post-hoc from these logs.

5. **Text-first agents** — most agents receive and return plain text. Only Sheldon (Memory) outputs structured JSON. Context is context; prose carries the same information as structured dicts for LLMs.

6. **Story blueprint** — the story world is defined once in `story.json` with setting, protagonist, narrative premise, `world_constraints`, and `tone_guidelines`. These two lists are NOT broadcast to every agent — each agent only receives the subset relevant to its role (see agent specs). The scenario JSON only contains user commands.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangGraph** — graph-based multi-agent orchestration
- **Pydantic v2** — all models (state, config, story, scenario, responses)
- **OpenAI SDK** — HTTP client for both vLLM (Gemma 4) and OpenAI API (GPT-4o)
- **Rich** — terminal UI
- **vLLM** — serves Gemma 4 locally on `localhost:8000` (started separately by the user)
- **PyYAML** — configs

## What to Build

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

**Pydantic models** (`src/state/story_state.py`, `src/models/`):
- `StoryState` in `src/state/story_state.py` — the shared state as defined in ARCHITECTURE.md. Lean, text-first. Includes story blueprint fields (setting, rules, premise) set once at initialization.
- `Story`, `Protagonist` in `src/models/story.py` — loaded from `story.json`. Includes `narrative_premise: str`, `world_constraints: list[str]`, and `tone_guidelines: list[str]`.
- `Config` in `src/models/config.py` — loaded from YAML
- `MemoryUpdate` in `src/models/responses.py` — structured output schema for Sheldon (Memory) only

**Utility modules** (`src/util/`):
- `prompt_loader.py` — load and format .md prompt templates (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `json_sanitizer.py` — JSON repair pipeline. Adapt from `reference/json_sanitizer.py`
- `interaction_logger.py` — log every LLM call to `logs/`. Adapt from `reference/interaction_logger.py`

**LLM backends** (`src/llm/`):
- `base.py` — abstract `LLMBackend` with `async generate(messages, temperature, max_tokens) -> str`. Should also return token usage.
- `gemma.py` — calls vLLM on `localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions` using the `openai` SDK with `base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1"`. Model from config.
- `openai_backend.py` — calls OpenAI API. Key from `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var.

Both backends: handle errors gracefully, return token usage, async, log via interaction_logger.

**Configs** (`configs/`):
YAML files for each of the 3 experiment configurations. Load into the `Config` Pydantic model.

### Phase 2: Prompts

Create all prompt templates in `src/prompts/`:

Each agent gets a `system.md` and `user.md`. The user template uses `{variable}` placeholders filled at call time.

**Critical:** Blueprint constraints are split. Tolkien gets NEITHER `world_constraints` nor `tone_guidelines` — he writes freely. Wilde gets ONLY `tone_guidelines`. Sherlock gets ONLY `world_constraints`. This split is what makes the benchmark meaningful — don't leak constraints into other prompts.

- `interpreter.system.md` / `interpreter.user.md` — parses raw user command into clarified intent, resolving vague references against world state.
- `narrator.system.md` / `narrator.user.md` — creative writing, user agency, story advancement. Receives setting, premise, and all context as prose — no constraints, no tone guidelines.
- `editor.system.md` / `editor.user.md` — polishes draft narration for LEGO-Movie tone. Receives `tone_guidelines`.
- `consistency.system.md` / `consistency.user.md` — analytical contradiction detection. Receives `world_constraints` and world state; flags violations.
- `memory.system.md` / `memory.user.md` — structured JSON extraction of world state updates. The user prompt should explicitly include the `MemoryUpdate` JSON schema so the LLM knows what structure to return.
- `director.system.md` / `director.user.md` — cinematic scene description for future I2V.
- `single_llm.system.md` / `single_llm.user.md` — one agent does everything

### Phase 3: Agents

Each agent is an async function: `async def agent_name(state: StoryState, llm: LLMBackend, config: Config, logger: InteractionLogger) -> dict`

Returns a partial state dict that LangGraph merges.

**Tolkien — Narrator** (`narrator.py`):
- Receives prose context: setting, narrative premise, summary, world state, recent beats, user input (or `user_intent` in full_cast)
- Does NOT receive world_constraints or tone_guidelines
- Writes: `current_narration` (draft in full_cast; final in core/solo)

**Sherlock — Consistency** (`consistency.py`):
- Receives prose context: narration, `world_constraints`, summary, world state, recent beats
- Writes: `consistency_flags`, `contradiction_count`
- Checks against established story facts AND world_constraints
- Does NOT rewrite narration — only flags issues

**Spielberg — Director** (`director.py`):
- Silent — output stored but never shown to the user
- Receives prose context: narration, world state
- Writes: `scene_description`
- Only included in `full_cast`

**Chomsky — Interpreter** (`interpreter.py`):
- Parses raw user command into a clarified intent before Tolkien writes
- Receives prose context: user input, world state, recent beats
- Writes: `user_intent`
- Only included in `full_cast`

**Wilde — Editor** (`editor.py`):
- Polishes Tolkien's draft for LEGO-Movie tone (light touch, no rewrite)
- Receives prose context: draft narration, tone guidelines
- Writes: `current_narration` (overwrites draft)
- Only included in `full_cast`

**Sheldon — Memory** (`memory.py`):
- The ONLY agent that outputs structured JSON
- Returns a `MemoryUpdate` parsed via the json_sanitizer pipeline
- MERGES updates into existing `world_state` — never overwrites unmentioned fields
- Every `summary_interval` turns, also generates a compressed `summary`

**All agents:**
- Load prompts via `prompt_loader`
- Log every call via `interaction_logger`
- Target ~4-8K tokens per call

### Phase 4: Graphs

**Solo** (`solo_graph.py`) — 1 agent:
```
Input → Single Agent → Output
```

**Core** (`core_graph.py`) — 3 agents:
```
Input → Tolkien → Sherlock ─┬─ (clean) → Sheldon → Output
                            └─ (flags + retries left) → Tolkien
```

**Full Cast** (`full_cast_graph.py`) — 6 agents:
```
Input
  → Chomsky (intent)
  → Tolkien (draft)
  → Wilde (polish)
  → Sherlock ─┬─ (clean) → Sheldon → Spielberg → Output
              └─ (flags + retries left) → Tolkien
```

Note: LangGraph wants TypedDict for state, but agents work with Pydantic models internally. Bridge this by converting at the graph boundary — `state.model_dump()` to pass in, `StoryState(**state_dict)` to reconstruct. Or use LangGraph's Pydantic state support if available.

### Phase 5: Terminal UI

(`src/ui/terminal.py`)

**Single flowing story.** Like reading a book. No panels, no sections, no slash commands.

- Rich for styled text
- Each turn: display narration as continuous flowing text
- Simple input prompt after each narration
- On startup: story setting and protagonist info, or a brief intro for free play
- Ctrl+C to quit

### Phase 6: Benchmark Runner

(`src/eval/runner.py`)

Run the scenario through a config. For each of the 100 turns: feed the user command, run the graph, log everything via interaction_logger. Save the full session log to `logs/`.

No judge, no metrics, no report generation. Just run and log. Evaluation happens afterwards.

### Phase 7: Entry Point

**`main.py`** with argparse:
- `play` — interactive (optional `--scenario`)
- `benchmark` — run the scenario against all configs, log everything

**`requirements.txt`**:
```
langgraph>=0.2.0
langchain>=0.3.0
langchain-openai>=0.2.0
langchain-community>=0.3.0
openai>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.0.0

```

## Guidelines

- **Pydantic everywhere** — state, config, story, responses. Not raw dicts.
- **Prompt templates as .md files** — never hardcode prompts as Python strings
- **Constraints are split, not shared** — `world_constraints` only to Sherlock; `tone_guidelines` only to Wilde; Tolkien gets neither
- **JSON sanitizer for Sheldon's output** — always go through the pipeline
- **Log every LLM call** — via interaction_logger
- **Text-first** — most agents work with prose, not structured data
- Async everywhere, type hints everywhere
- `logging` module, not print
- Errors handled gracefully
- Functions over classes where possible (agents are functions)
- Follow the project structure exactly

## What NOT to Build

- No web frontend
- No database
- No Docker
- No vLLM management
- No model fine-tuning
- No automated judge or scoring pipeline
- No matplotlib reports
